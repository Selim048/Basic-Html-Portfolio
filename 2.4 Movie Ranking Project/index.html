My favorite movies of all time:
</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>
The Pianist
</h3>
<p>
This movie lands on top of my list, as it made me cry so much <br/>
and I feel like I have lived through similar problems myself. <br/>
The director did a great job in making the show realistic and <br/>
really showing the feelings of the poor pianist. With the main<br/>
role being one of my favorites, this movie gets a 10/10 from me! <br/>

<h2>
<br/>
The Book of Life
</h2>
<p>
This movie is a big part of my childhood. I loved it so much that <br/>
I would come back again and again to watch it. The music <br/>
was great, the message was very sweet and the plot was done <br/>
justice. As I was a small kid then I was really invested in <br/>
the love plot as well. This movie is a great watch as a fantasy movie <br/>
even for adults and I would 100 precent recommend it to everyone!<br/>

<h3>
<br/>
The Wind Rises
</h3>
<p>
Even if the world of animation has progressed to greater lengths, this <br/>
movie still remains a masterpiece. It comes with great colours mixed with <br/>
incredible music and a great story. You might see a pattern with me and dramas, <br/>
but I promise you will not regret watching this movie in particular. So even <br/>
if you are not a big fan of anime, give the productions of studio ghibli a try.<br/>
